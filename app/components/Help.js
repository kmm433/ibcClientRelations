                          You can create a new notification by selecting "Create New Notice" from the side menu, and
                          choosing between a Notice, Event or Survey from the tabbed menu. As you fill out the form,
                          a preview will appear showing you what your notice will look like for your members.
                          <br/><br/>
                          Once you have finished filling out the details you can choose who will recieve your notification.
                          Under the "Choose Recipients" section, you can choose to post to your entire chamber, or choose individual
                          businesses and groups. A further option is available to offer the notification to any child chambers
                          your chamber may have, but an Executive Member from that chamber will have to approve it before it
                          displayed to their members.
